## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a publicly available dataset (e.g., Kaggle).

To maintain repository cleanliness and respect potential licensing constraints, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Download the dataset from the original source.
2. Place the file inside a `data/` folder.
3. Update the file path in the notebook if necessary.
